# CMPT213-Maze Exploration Game

Description:
This is a treasure hunting game where the player controls a
treasure hunter to collect relics hidden in a maze. Whenever the treasure hunter reaches the cell with a
relic in it, the treasure hunter automatically collects that relic and another relic appears somewhere in the
maze. Unfortunate to the treasure hunter, there are 3 guardians in the maze and kills anyone who is
looking for the treasures. If a guardian and the treasure hunter occupy the same cell, the guardian kills
the treasure hunter and the player loses the game (note: it is possible to have more than one guardian in
the same cell). Fortunately, the guardians are not very smart, so they cannot track the treasure hunter:
they move pseudo-randomly and are not affected by where the treasure hunter is.
